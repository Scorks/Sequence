The game Sequence!!!

needs to have:

user authentication (i.e., the system requires users to be registered and they must sign-in to use most of the system),
a registration web page to allow a user to create an account,
a web page to change account detail for a user (e.g., change the account's password),
a set of administrative web pages that can modify and delete user accounts (administrative web pages should only be accessible by an administrator),
all the other web pages required for the web application.
CSS must be used to style the pages, the styling should be consistent across all pages.
JSON and AJAX must be used for some of the pages.

steps in somewhat arbitrary order:
1. user authentication, registration pages, admin pages, account
settings
1.1 database?
2. get 1 on 1 game working
3. chatroom
4. leaderboard
...
n. extras - favorites/friends, badges, AI, color schemes, social media
sharing, randomized board mode...
